### Why?
Online, home-based exercises have surged in popularity throughout the pandemic with gyms and fitness studios closed. This trend is also evidenced by Peloton Interactive Inc., a home fitness company that sells stationary bikes and subscription-based spinning classes, to gain over a million people signing up to free trials between March and April. 

This acquisition by Lululemon can be seen as part of the company's three-year expansion plan. Lululemon has recognised the huge potential of   at-home fitness

#### Discussion
Will the trend of home workouts continue once gyms reopen? Whilst the Lululemon-Mirror acquisition can seem like a smart move now with the popularity of home-based exercises, it is hard to predict whether people will still stick to home workouts even after gyms reopen. Here is what RBC Capital Markets analyst Kate Fitzsimons had to say: "The reality is you have more people streaming yoga in YouTube videos. You have more people working out from home. And I think some of that behaviour, obviously, is going to stick on the other side of the pandemic. With people realizing that they can workout from home, why would you pay the $200-plus for an Equinox membership?"
